# TVM linker

This repository stores the source code for tvm_linker utility. It takes TVM (https://test.ton.org/tvm.pdf) 
assembly source code of TON smart contract, compiles it and links its parts, adds standard selector 
and runtime and stores it into binary TVC file. Also, it can immediately execute a smart 
contract by emulating the compute phase of TON transaction.

TVM assembly can be generated by one of TONLabs compilers:
- TON solidity compiler (https://github.com/tonlabs/TON-Solidity-Compiler)
- C and C++ compiler for TVM (https://github.com/tonlabs/TON-Compiler)

## Prerequesites

- Rust v. 1.38 or newer
- Cargo tool


## How to build

	cd tvm_linker && cargo build [--release]

## How to use

tvm_linker has several modes of work:

### 1) Generating a ready-to-deploy contract.
    tvm_linker compile [--lib <lib_file>] [--abi-json <abi_file>] [--genkey | --setkey <keyfile>] [-w <workchain_id>] [--debug] <source>

Here `source` is a name of tvm assembly source file, `library` is a runtime library file (can be more than one: `--lib` 
should be supplied for every file).

If there is an ABI file, it is better to use `--abi-json` option to supply a contract ABI file. Function ID's are generated according to function signatures in the ABI.

Linker generates an `address.tvc` file, where `address` is a hash from initial data and code of the contract.

Linker prints contract address in different formats: raw and user-friendly (testnet and mainnet). Define the workchain ID option `-w` to generate proper user-friendly address. -1 is used by default.

To generate a new keypair and put the public key to the contract:

	tvm_linker compile <source> --genkey <key_file>

where `key_file` is a name of the file to store public and private keys. The linker will generate 2 files: `key_file.pub` for public key and `key_file` for private key.

To load existing keypair use:

	tvm_linker compile <source> --setkey <key_file>

### 2) Decoding of .boc messages prepared externally.
To use this method, call

	tvm_linker decode [--tvc] boc-file

If `--tvc` is omitted, `boc-file` is a file with a serialized message, otherwise it is a contract `tvc` file.

### 3) Preparing an external inbound messages in .boc format.

First, generate a contract as described in 1). Then use `message` subcommand to create external inbound message in boc format:

	tvm_linker message <contract-address> [--init] [--data] [-w]

	tvm_linker message <contract-address> [--init] --abi-json <abi_file> --abi-method <method_name> --abi-params {json_with_params} [-w]

`contract-address` - the name of the compiled contract file without extension. The contract .tvc file should be placed in the current directory.

To create a `constructor message` with contract's code and data, use `--init` option.

Aditionally, you can add a raw body to the message. Use the `--data` option:

	tvm_linker message <contract-address> --data XXXX...

Instead of `XXXX...`, specify the necessary message body in hex format. 

Or make a message with ABI call using combination of options:
- `--abi-json <abi_file>` - path to a .json with contract interface described according to ABI specification;
- `--abi-method <method-name>` - name of the contract method to call;
- `--abi-params {<json-string-with-params>}` - arguments of the method declared in json like this: `{"arg_a": "0x1234", "arg_b": "x12345678"}`.

By default, -1 is used as a workchain id in contract address. To use another one, use `-w` option:

	tvm_linker message -w 0

### 4) Emulating contract execution:

Linker can emulate compute phase of blockchain transaction. It is useful for contract debugging.

	tvm_linker test <contract-address> --body XXXX... [--sign key-file] [--trace] [--decode-c6] [--internal value] [--src address] [--now unixtime] [-s source-file]

Loads contract from file by contract address `address` and emulates contract call sending external inbound message (by default) with body defined after `--body` parameter to the contract. `XXXX...` is a hex string. 

If `--sign` specified, the body will be signed with the private key from `key-file` file.

Use `--trace` flag to trace VM execution: stack, registers and gas will be printed after each executed VM command.

Use `--decode-c6` to see output actions in user friendly format.

Use `--internal` to send internal message to the contract with defined nanograms in `value`. By default, source address in internal message in zero address (`0000...0000`), to define another address use option `--src <address>`, where address should be in the format <wc>:<bytes32> (i.e. "0:1122...AABB"). 

Example: `--internal 100000 --src "0:6011b66a47238cf992f1033fe6aff00ce0f850df387ee92468d9c26b5564ba53"`

Use `--now <unixtime>` option to define transaction creation time. By default, current time is used.

An ABI body can be generated if `abi-params`, `abi-json` and `abi-method` will be used instead of `--body XXXX...`.

If `--body` is used, contract's public function ids can be encoded by their names using `$...$` syntax:`$name:[0len][type]$`, 
where `name` is a name of public function, `len` - length in chars of the id (if `len` is bigger than `name`'s length in chars than 
zeros will be added at the left side to fit required length), `type` can be `x` or `X` - hexademical integer  in lowercase or uppercase. You have to set `-s source` option when you use $...$ syntax.

Example:

	tvm_linker address test --body 00$main$ -s source //main id will be inserted as decimal string. Dont use this case, just as example
	tvm_linker address test --body 00$main:08X$ -s source
	tvm_linker address test --body 00$main:X$ -s source
	tvm_linker address test --body 00$main:x$ -s source

### More Help
Use `tvm_linker --help` for detailed description about all options, flags and subcommands.

## Input format

As a temporary measure, some LLVM-assembler like input is used. The source code should contain several function types:

- .selector - contract's entry point. This function should be short.

```
	.selector
	<code here>
```

- .globl - general purpose functions; can be public or private.

```
	.globl	x
	[.public x]
	.type x, @function
	x:
	<code here>
```

- .internal - special functions, which are used only by contract's runtime. There are some wellknown internal functions:

	main_external, main_internal, main_ticktock, main_split, main_merge
